    Here, we're sending data to the MYSQL database immediately when an instance of the object is created. When an object instance is created, the data passed as arguments is sent to the database using "insertData" function. And when updating the data, we're making the changes in the instance of object and then we're updating the data in the database, which is performed by "updateData" function. The "updateDept" is used to change the department of the student, as we've seperate table for seperate department(remove from one deptTable and add it to the specified deptTable). The "updateCount" holds the number of students data currently under each department.
