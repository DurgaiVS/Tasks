    Here, we are reading the data from the json file authFile (which is performed by "dataParse" function), and then inserting the data to the database MYSQL, and here the instance of the object is volatile, as we're sending data to the database immediately when an object instance is created. When updating the data, we directly update the in database by calling "dataUpdate" function. Also, we can fetch the necessary data from the database using "dataFetch" function.
