    Here, we've created the instance of the objects Student, Department, College. Each instance is added to the specified department array, which is done by "dataFile". In case of an update in data, we've made the update in the object instance as well as the specified department array(The department array is used to insert the data to local database), which is done by "updateDept" function. Now, to update the department, we remove the item from the department array using the "id" given, and add it to the new department array, which is done by "updateDept" function. Now, after creating all the instances and performiing necessary updates, we then send the data as a whole to the database, which is done by "wholeInsertion" function. We connect to the local database using localhost and insert the data to MYSQL database.
